            "description": "NAXSI is an open-source maintenance web application firewall (WAF) for NGINX. An issue present starting in version 1.3 and prior to version 1.6 allows someone to bypass the WAF when a malicious `X-Forwarded-For` IP matches `IgnoreIP` `IgnoreCIDR` rules. This old code was arranged to allow older NGINX versions to also support `IgnoreIP` `IgnoreCIDR` when multiple reverse proxies were present. The issue is patched in version 1.6. As a workaround, do not set any `IgnoreIP` `IgnoreCIDR` for older versions.\n",
