This vulnerability is due to improper processing of serialized Java objects by the affected application. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by uploading a document containing malicious serialized Java objects to be processed by the affected application. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause the application to execute arbitrary commands.",
