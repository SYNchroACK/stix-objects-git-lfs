            "description": "An issue was discovered in Nokia NetAct before 22 FP2211. On the Scheduled Search tab under the Alarm Reports Dashboard page, users can create a script to inject XSS. Input validation was missing during creation of a scheduled task. For an external attacker, it is very difficult to exploit this, because a few dynamically created parameters such as Jsession-id, a CSRF token, and an Nxsrf token would be needed. The attack can realistically only be performed by an internal user.",
