            "description": "Mozilla developers Randell Jesup, Andrew Osmond, Sebastian Hengst, Andrew McCreight, and the Mozilla Fuzzing Team reported memory safety bugs present in Firefox 111 and Firefox ESR 102.9. Some of these bugs showed evidence of memory corruption and we presume that with enough effort some of these could have been exploited to run arbitrary code. This vulnerability affects Firefox < 112, Focus for Android < 112, Firefox ESR < 102.10, Firefox for Android < 112, and Thunderbird < 102.10.",
