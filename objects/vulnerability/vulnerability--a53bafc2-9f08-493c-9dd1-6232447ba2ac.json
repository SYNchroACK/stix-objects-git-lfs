            "description": "\nAn Improper Handling of Syntactically Invalid Structure vulnerability in Object Flooding Protocol (OFP) service of Juniper Networks Junos OS Evolved allows an unauthenticated, network-based attacker to cause a Denial of Service (DoS).\n\nOn all Junos OS Evolved platforms, when specific TCP packets are received on an open OFP port, the OFP crashes leading to a restart of Routine Engine (RE). Continuous receipt of these specific TCP packets will lead to a sustained Denial of Service (DoS) condition.\n\nThis issue affects:\n\nJuniper Networks Junos OS Evolved\n\n\n\n  *  All versions earlier than 21.2R3-S7-EVO;\n  *  21.3 versions earlier than 21.3R3-S5-EVO ;\n  *  21.4 versions earlier than 21.4R3-S5-EVO;\n  *  22.1 versions earlier than 22.1R3-S4-EVO;\n  *  22.2 versions earlier than 22.2R3-S3-EVO ;\n  *  22.3 versions earlier than 22.3R3-EVO;\n  *  22.4 versions earlier than 22.4R2-EVO, 22.4R3-EVO.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
