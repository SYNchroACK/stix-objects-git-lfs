            "description": "Requests to cache an image could be abused to include SQL queries that would be executed unchecked. Exploiting this vulnerability requires at least access to adjacent networks of the imageconverter service, which is not exposed to public networks by default. Arbitrary SQL statements could be executed in the context of the services database user account. API requests are now properly checked for valid content and attempts to circumvent this check are being logged as error. No publicly available exploits are known.\n\n",
