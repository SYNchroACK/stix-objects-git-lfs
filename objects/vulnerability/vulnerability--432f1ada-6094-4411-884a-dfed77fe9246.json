If non-default HTTP       connector settings were used such that the maxParameterCount could be reached using query string parameters and a request was       submitted that supplied exactly maxParameterCount parameters in the query string, the limit for uploaded request parts could be bypassed with the potential for a denial of service to occur.\n\n\n\n\n",
