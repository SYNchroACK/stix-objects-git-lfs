            "description": "Nexkey is a fork of Misskey, an open source, decentralized social media platform. Prior to version 12.121.9, incomplete URL validation can allow users to bypass authentication for access to the job queue dashboard. Version 12.121.9 contains a fix for this issue. As a workaround, it may be possible to avoid this by blocking access using tools such as Cloudflare's WAF.",
