            "description": "XWiki Commons are technical libraries common to several other top level XWiki projects. It is possible to bypass the existing security measures put in place to avoid open redirect by using a redirect such as `//mydomain.com` (i.e. omitting the `http:`). It was also possible to bypass it when using URL such as `http:/mydomain.com`. The problem has been patched on XWiki 13.10.10, 14.4.4 and 14.8RC1.\n",
