            "description": "A use-after-free vulnerability in the Linux kernel's net/sched: cls_u32 component can be exploited to achieve local privilege escalation.\n\nWhen u32_change() is called on an existing filter, the whole tcf_result struct is always copied into the new instance of the filter. This causes a problem when updating a filter bound to a class, as tcf_unbind_filter() is always called on the old instance in the success path, decreasing filter_cnt of the still referenced class and allowing it to be deleted, leading to a use-after-free.\n\nWe recommend upgrading past commit 3044b16e7c6fe5d24b1cdbcf1bd0a9d92d1ebd81.\n\n",
