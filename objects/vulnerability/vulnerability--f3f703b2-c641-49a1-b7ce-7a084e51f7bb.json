Any user with view rights `WikiManager.DeleteWiki` can execute arbitrary Groovy, Python or Velocity code in XWiki leading to full access to the XWiki installation. The root cause is improper escaping of the `wikiId` url parameter. The problem has been patched on XWiki  13.10.11, 14.4.7, and 14.10.",
