            "description": "SEMCMS 3.9 is vulnerable to SQL Injection. Due to the lack of security checks on the input of the application, the attacker uses the existing application to inject malicious SQL commands into the background database engine for execution, and sends some attack codes as commands or query statements to the interpreter. These malicious data can deceive the interpreter, so as to execute unplanned commands or unauthorized access to data.",
