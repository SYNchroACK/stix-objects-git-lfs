            "description": "Form block is a wordpress plugin designed to make form creation easier. Versions prior to 1.0.2 are subject to a Cross-Site Request Forgery due to a missing nonce check. There is potential for a Cross Site Request Forgery for all form blocks, since it allows to send requests to the forms from any website without a user noticing. Users are advised to upgrade to version 1.0.2. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.",
