            "description": "XWiki Commons are technical libraries common to several other top level XWiki projects. It's possible to list some users who are normally not viewable from subwiki by requesting users on a subwiki which allows only global users with `uorgsuggest.vm`. This issue only concerns hidden users from main wiki. Note that the disclosed information are the username and the first and last name of users, no other information is leaked. The problem has been patched on XWiki 13.10.8, 14.4.3 and 14.7RC1. \n",
