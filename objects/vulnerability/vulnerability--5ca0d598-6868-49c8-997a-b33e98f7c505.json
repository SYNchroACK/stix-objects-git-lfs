This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to send emails utilizing the vulnerable site's server, with arbitrary content. Please note that this vulnerability has already been publicly disclosed with an exploit which is why we are publishing the details without a patch available, we are attempting to initiate contact with the developer.",
