            "description": "XWiki Platform is a generic wiki platform offering runtime services for applications built on top of it. In affected versions it's possible to display or interact with any page a user cannot access through the combination of the async and display macros. A comment with either macro will be executed when viewed providing a code injection vector in the context of the running server. This vulnerability has been patched in XWiki 15.0-rc-1, 14.10.3, 14.4.8, and 13.10.11. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this issue.",
