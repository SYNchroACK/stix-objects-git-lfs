            "description": "The Syrus4 IoT gateway utilizes an unsecured MQTT server to download and execute arbitrary commands, allowing a remote unauthenticated attacker to execute code on any Syrus4 device connected to the cloud service. The MQTT server also leaks the location, video and diagnostic data from each connected device. An attacker who knows the IP address of the server is able to connect and perform the following operations:\n\n  *  Get location data of the vehicle the device is connected to\n  *  Send CAN bus messages via the ECU module ( https://syrus.digitalcomtech.com/docs/ecu-1 https://syrus.digitalcomtech.com/docs/ecu-1 )\n\n  *  Immobilize the vehicle via the safe-immobilizer module ( https://syrus.digitalcomtech.com/docs/system-tools#safe-immobilization https://syrus.digitalcomtech.com/docs/system-tools#safe-immobilization )\n\n  *  Get live video through the connected video camera\n\n  *  Send audio messages to the driver ( https://syrus.digitalcomtech.com/docs/system-tools#apx-tts https://syrus.digitalcomtech.com/docs/system-tools#apx-tts )\n\n\n\n\n\n",
