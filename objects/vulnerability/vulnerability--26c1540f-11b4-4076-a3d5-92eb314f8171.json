            "description": "The VK Blocks plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via the plugin's 'vk-blocks/ancestor-page-list' block in all versions up to, and including, 1.63.0.1 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping on user supplied attributes. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers with contributor-level and above permissions to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page.",
