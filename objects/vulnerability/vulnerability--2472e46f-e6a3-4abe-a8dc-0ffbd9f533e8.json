            "description": "LilyPond before 2.24 allows attackers to bypass the -dsafe protection mechanism via output-def-lookup or output-def-scope, as demonstrated by dangerous Scheme code in a .ly file that causes arbitrary code execution during conversion to a different file format. NOTE: in 2.24 and later versions, safe mode is removed, and the product no longer tries to block code execution when external files are used.",
