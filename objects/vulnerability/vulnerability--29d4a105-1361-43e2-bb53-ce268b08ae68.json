            "description": "\nAn Improper Check for Unusual or Exceptional Conditions vulnerability in Routing Protocol Daemon (RPD) of Juniper Networks Junos OS and Junos OS Evolved allows a network-based, unauthenticated attacker to cause rpd to crash, leading to Denial of Service (DoS).\n\nOn all Junos OS and Junos OS Evolved platforms, when NETCONF and gRPC are enabled, and a specific query is executed via Dynamic Rendering (DREND), rpd will crash and restart. Continuous execution of this specific query will cause a sustained Denial of Service (DoS) condition.\n\nThis issue affects:\n\nJuniper Networks Junos OS\n\n\n\n  *  22.2 versions earlier than 22.2R2-S2, 22.2R3;\n  *  22.3 versions earlier than 22.3R2, 22.3R3.\n\n\n\n\nJuniper Networks Junos OS Evolved\n\n\n\n  *  22.2 versions earlier than 22.2R2-S2-EVO, 22.2R3-EVO;\n  *  22.3 versions earlier than 22.3R2-EVO, 22.3R3-EVO.\n\n\n\n\nThis issue does not affect Juniper Networks:\n\nJunos OS versions earlier than 22.2R1;\n\nJunos OS Evolved versions earlier than 22.2R1-EVO.\n\n\n\n",
