            "description": "A vulnerability in the SSH service of Cisco Catalyst SD-WAN Manager could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause a process crash, resulting in a DoS condition for SSH access only. This vulnerability does not prevent the system from continuing to function, and web UI access is not affected.\r\n\r This vulnerability is due to insufficient resource management when an affected system is in an error condition. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending malicious traffic to the affected system. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause the SSH process to crash and restart, resulting in a DoS condition for the SSH service.",
