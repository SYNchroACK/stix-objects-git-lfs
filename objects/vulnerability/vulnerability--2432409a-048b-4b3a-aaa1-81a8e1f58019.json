            "description": "sbt is a build tool for Scala, Java, and others. Given a specially crafted zip or JAR file, `IO.unzip` allows writing of arbitrary file. This would have potential to overwrite `/root/.ssh/authorized_keys`. Within sbt's main code, `IO.unzip` is used in `pullRemoteCache` task and `Resolvers.remote`; however many projects use `IO.unzip(...)` directly to implement custom tasks. This vulnerability has been patched in version 1.9.7.",
