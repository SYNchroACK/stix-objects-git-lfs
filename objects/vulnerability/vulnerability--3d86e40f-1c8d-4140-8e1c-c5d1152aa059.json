            "description": "The Weaver Xtreme theme for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via custom post meta in all versions up to, and including, 6.3.0 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping on user supplied meta (page-head-code). This makes it possible for authenticated attackers with contributor-level and above permissions to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page.",
