            "description": "The WP Hotel Booking plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in versions up to, and including, 1.10.1. This is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation on the admin_add_order_item() function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to add an order item via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link.",
