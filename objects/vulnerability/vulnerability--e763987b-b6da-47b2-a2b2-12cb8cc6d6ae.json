            "description": "An issue was discovered in Faronics Insight 10.0.19045 on Windows. It is possible for a remote attacker to communicate with the private API endpoints exposed at /login, /consoleSettings, /console, etc. despite Virtual Host Routing being used to block this access. Remote attackers can interact with private pages on the web server, enabling them to perform privileged actions such as logging into the console and changing console settings if they have valid credentials.",
