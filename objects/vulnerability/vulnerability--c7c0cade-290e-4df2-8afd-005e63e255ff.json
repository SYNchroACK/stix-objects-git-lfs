            "description": "aiven-extras is a PostgreSQL extension. Versions prior to 1.1.9 contain a privilege escalation vulnerability, allowing elevation to superuser inside PostgreSQL databases that use the aiven-extras package. The vulnerability leverages missing schema qualifiers on privileged functions called by the aiven-extras extension. A low privileged user can create objects that collide with existing function names, which will then be executed instead. Exploiting this vulnerability could allow a low privileged user to acquire `superuser` privileges, which would allow full, unrestricted access to all data and database functions. And could lead to arbitrary code execution or data access on the underlying host as the `postgres` user. The issue has been patched as of version 1.1.9.",
