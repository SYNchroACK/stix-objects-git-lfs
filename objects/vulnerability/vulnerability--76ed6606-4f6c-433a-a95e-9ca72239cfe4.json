            "description": "There's a use-after-free vulnerability in grub_cmd_chainloader() function; The chainloader command is used to boot up operating systems that doesn't support multiboot and do not have direct support from GRUB2. When executing chainloader more than once a use-after-free vulnerability is triggered. If an attacker can control the GRUB2's memory allocation pattern sensitive data may be exposed and arbitrary code execution can be achieved.",
