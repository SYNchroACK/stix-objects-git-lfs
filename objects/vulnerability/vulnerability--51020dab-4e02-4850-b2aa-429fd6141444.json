            "description": "An issue was discovered on GL.iNet devices before 3.216. There is an arbitrary file write in which an empty file can be created anywhere on the filesystem. This is caused by a command injection vulnerability with a filter applied. Through the software installation feature, it is possible to inject arbitrary parameters in a request to cause opkg to read an arbitrary file name while using root privileges. The -f option can be used with a configuration file.",
