            "description": "The mod_jk component of Apache Tomcat Connectors in some circumstances, such as when a configuration included \"JkOptions +ForwardDirectories\" but the configuration did not       provide explicit mounts for all possible proxied requests, mod_jk would       use an implicit mapping and map the request to the first defined worker. Such an implicit mapping could result in the unintended exposure of the status worker and/or bypass security constraints configured in httpd. As of JK 1.2.49, the implicit mapping functionality has been removed and all mappings must now be via explicit configuration. Only mod_jk is affected by this issue. The ISAPI redirector is not affected.\n\nThis issue affects Apache Tomcat Connectors (mod_jk only): from 1.2.0 through 1.2.48.\n\nUsers are recommended to upgrade to version 1.2.49, which fixes the issue.\n\n",
