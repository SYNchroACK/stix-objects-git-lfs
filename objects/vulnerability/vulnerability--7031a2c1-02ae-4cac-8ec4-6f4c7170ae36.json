            "description": "The Export and Import Users and Customers plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to arbitrary file uploads due to insufficient file type validation on the 'upload_import_file' function in versions up to, and including, 2.4.8. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers with shop manager-level capabilities or above, to upload arbitrary files on the affected site's server which may make remote code execution possible.",
