This makes it possible for authenticated attackers with subscriber privileges to delete arbitrary files on the server, which makes it possible to take over affected sites as well as others sharing the same hosting account. This vulnerability is the same as CVE-2023-5212 but was accidentally reintroduced in version 4.9.2.",
