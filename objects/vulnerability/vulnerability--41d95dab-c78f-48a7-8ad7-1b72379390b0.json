            "description": "Cacti is an open source operational monitoring and fault management framework. Affected versions are subject to a Stored Cross-Site-Scripting (XSS) Vulnerability which allows an authenticated user to poison data stored in the _cacti_'s database. These data will be viewed by administrative _cacti_ accounts and execute JavaScript code in the victim's browser at view-time. The script under `data_sources.php` displays the data source management information (e.g. data source path, polling configuration etc.) for different data visualizations of the _cacti_ app. CENSUS found that an adversary that is able to configure a malicious data-source path, can deploy a stored XSS attack against any user of the same (or broader) privileges. A user that possesses the 'General Administration>Sites/Devices/Data' permissions can configure the data source path in Cacti. This configuration occurs through `http://<HOST>/cacti/data_sources.php`. The same page can be used for previewing the data source path. This issue has been addressed in version 1.2.25. Users are advised to upgrade. Users unable to upgrade should manually escape HTML output.\n",
