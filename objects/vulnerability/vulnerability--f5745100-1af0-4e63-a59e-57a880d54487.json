            "description": "The RSS Aggregator by Feedzy plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in versions up to, and including, 3.4.2. This is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation on the save_feedzy_post_type_meta() function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to update post meta via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link.",
