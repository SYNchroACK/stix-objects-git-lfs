            "description": "GeoNode is an open source platform that facilitates the creation, sharing, and collaborative use of geospatial data. A SSRF vulnerability exists starting in version 3.2.0, bypassing existing controls on the software. This can allow a user to request internal services for a full read SSRF, returning any data from the internal network. The application is using a whitelist, but the whitelist can be bypassed. The bypass will trick the application that the first host is a whitelisted address, but the browser will use `@` or `%40` as a credential to the host geoserver on port 8080, this will return the data to that host on the response. As of time of publication, no patched version is available.",
