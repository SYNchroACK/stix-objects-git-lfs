A failure in the update logic of Rancher's admission Webhook may lead to\n the misconfiguration of the Webhook. This component enforces validation\n rules and security checks before resources are admitted into the \nKubernetes cluster.\nThe issue only affects users that upgrade from 2.6.x or 2.7.x to 2.7.2. Users that did a fresh install of 2.7.2 (and did not follow an upgrade path) are not affected.\n\n",
