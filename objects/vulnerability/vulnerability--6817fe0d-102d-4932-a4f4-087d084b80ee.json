            "description": "The AI ChatBot for WordPress is vulnerable to Directory Traversal in version 4.9.2 via the qcld_openai_upload_pagetraining_file function. This allows subscriber-level attackers to append \"<?php\" to any existing file on the server resulting in potential DoS when appended to critical files such as wp-config.php. This vulnerability is the same as CVE-2023-5241, but was reintroduced in version 4.9.2.",
