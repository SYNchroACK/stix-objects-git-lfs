This vulnerability allows an attacker to perform denial of service attacks by providing specially crafted responses from a Git server which triggers resource exhaustion in go-git clients.\n\nApplications using only the in-memory filesystem supported by go-git are not affected by this vulnerability.\nThis is a go-git implementation issue and does not affect the upstream git cli.\n\n\n",
