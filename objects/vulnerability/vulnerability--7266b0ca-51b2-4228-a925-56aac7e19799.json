It allows an authenticated user to to obtain information about whether certain files exist on disk, what errors if any occur when attempting to read them, and some limited information about their contents (regardless of permissions). This can occur when a superuser has configured one or more directories for filesystem access via CREATE DIRECTORY and adopted certain non-default settings for log_line_prefix and log_connections.",
