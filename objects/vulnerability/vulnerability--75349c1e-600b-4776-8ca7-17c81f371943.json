            "description": "Nginx-ui is online statistics for Server Indicators​​ Monitor CPU usage, memory usage, load average, and disk usage in real-time. The `Home > Preference` page exposes a small list of nginx settings such as `Nginx Access Log Path` and `Nginx Error Log Path`. However, the API also exposes `test_config_cmd`, `reload_cmd` and `restart_cmd`. While the UI doesn't allow users to modify any of these settings, it is possible to do so by sending a request to the API. This issue may lead to authenticated Remote Code Execution, Privilege Escalation, and Information Disclosure. This issue has been patched in version 2.0.0.beta.9.",
