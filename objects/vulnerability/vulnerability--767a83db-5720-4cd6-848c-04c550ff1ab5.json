            "description": "\n\nA failure in the -fstack-protector feature in GCC-based toolchains \nthat target AArch64 allows an attacker to exploit an existing buffer \noverflow in dynamically-sized local variables in your application \nwithout this being detected. This stack-protector failure only applies \nto C99-style dynamically-sized local variables or those created using \nalloca(). The stack-protector operates as intended for statically-sized \nlocal variables.\n\nThe default behavior when the stack-protector \ndetects an overflow is to terminate your application, resulting in \ncontrolled loss of availability. An attacker who can exploit a buffer \noverflow without triggering the stack-protector might be able to change \nprogram flow control to cause an uncontrolled loss of availability or to\n go further and affect confidentiality or integrity.\n\n\n\n\n\n",
