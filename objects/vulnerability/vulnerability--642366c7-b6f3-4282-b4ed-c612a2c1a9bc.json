            "description": "An issue was discovered in Paessler PRTG Network Monitor 23.2.83.1760 x64. To exploit the vulnerability, a authenticated user can create a SQL Sensor. When creating this sensor, the user can set the SQL message that should be sent from the PRTG device. This input parameter contains a path traversal vulnerability that allows an attacker to choose arbitrary files from the system. They will be transmitted over the internet to the attacker's machine.",
