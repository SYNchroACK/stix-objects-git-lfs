            "description": "The Realia plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in versions up to, and including, 1.4.0. This is due to missing nonce validation on the 'process_change_profile_form' function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to change user email via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link.",
