            "description": "XWiki Platform is a generic wiki platform offering runtime services for applications built on top of it. Users are able to forge an URL with a payload allowing to inject Javascript in the page (XSS). It's possible to exploit the restore template to perform a XSS, e.g. by using URL such as: > /xwiki/bin/view/XWiki/Main?xpage=restore&showBatch=true&xredirect=javascript:alert(document.domain). This vulnerability exists since XWiki 9.4-rc-1. The vulnerability has been patched in XWiki 14.10.5 and 15.1-rc-1. ",
