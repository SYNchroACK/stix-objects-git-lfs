            "description": " XWiki Commons are technical libraries common to several other top level XWiki projects. The Livetable Macro wasn't properly sanitizing column names, thus allowing the insertion of raw HTML code including JavaScript. This vulnerability was also exploitable via the Documents Macro that is included since XWiki 3.5M1 and doesn't require script rights, this can be demonstrated with the syntax `{{documents id=\"example\" count=\"5\" actions=\"false\" columns=\"doc.title, before<script>alert(1)</script>after\"/}}`. Therefore, this can also be exploited by users without script right and in comments. With the interaction of a user with more rights, this could be used to execute arbitrary actions in the wiki, including privilege escalation, remote code execution, information disclosure, modifying or deleting content. This has been patched in XWiki 14.9, 14.4.6, and 13.10.10.\n",
