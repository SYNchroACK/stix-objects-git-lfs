The network configuration service of affected devices contains a flaw in the conversion of ipv4 addresses that could lead to an uninitialized variable being used in succeeding validation steps.\r\n\r\nBy uploading specially crafted network configuration, an authenticated remote attacker could be able to inject commands that are executed on the device with root privileges during device startup.",
