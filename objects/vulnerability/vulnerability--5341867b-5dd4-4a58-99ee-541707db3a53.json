This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on affected installations of Softing edgeAggregator. Authentication is required to exploit this vulnerability.\n\nThe specific flaw exists within the processing of backup zip files. The issue results from the lack of proper validation of a user-supplied path prior to using it in file operations. An attacker can leverage this to execute code in the context of root.
